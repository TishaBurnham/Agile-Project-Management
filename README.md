# Agile-Project-Management

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
>> During the beginning stages, I meet with the client, stakeholders, and customers to discuss the goals and expectations of the product. I ensure that I ask any questions involving the development, deadline, and cost involved to ensure a sufficient delivery. The information obtain at this meeting can help create the user stories the development team uses to create the product. The user stories are prioritized based off of important and issued during a 2 to 4-week sprint.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
>> Since I started coding, I was taught to create a pseudocode before typing any code. This was a way to help plan and structure the code so that it's organized and includes all the necessary functions needed to produce the product promised. After learning Agile, some of the features that I plan to incorporate in my future projects would be the use of iterations and a scrum board. I haven't always been the best at organizing my code, sometimes I just jump right into it and start entering code without any true plan. I also made it a habit to wait until the last minute to start coding the project. Using iterations will help me break my project into smaller pieces. This will help to ensure that my code functions without bugs and runs before starting the next section of code. User stories can take place of pseudocode and flow charts since it lays out the requirements of the project.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
>> A good team member is someone that meets deadlines and communicates effectively with the team. They are willing to assist in area's that other's may not be a as knowledgeable in for the benefit of the team. A team member should always lend a helping hand to his fellow members. They should ensure that they reach out and communicate when they are unsure on a topic and need clarification.
